What is a Material?
A material determines how the surface of something looks. At a basic level, a material defines four things:

Base Color: The color or texture of a surface. Used to add detail and color variations.
Metallic: How “metal-like” a surface is. Generally, a pure metal will have the maximum Metallic value whereas fabric will have a value of zero.
Specular: Controls the shininess of non-metallic surfaces. For example, ceramic would have a high Specular value but clay would not.
Roughness: A surface with maximum roughness will not have any shininess. Used for surfaces such as rock and wood.


Blueprints allow you to create custom behaviors for your objects. Your object can be something physical (like the turntable) or something abstract such as a health system.

Note: If you prefer to write code, you can use C++ instead.

While Blueprints are easy to use, they are not as fast as C++ code. So, if you need to use something computationally heavy like a complex algorithm, you should consider using C++.

Even if you prefer using C++, there are times where it is a good idea to use Blueprints. Here are some of the benefits of Blueprints:

Generally, it is quicker to develop using Blueprints than C++.
Easy organization. You can separate your nodes into different areas such as functions and graphs.
If you are working with non-programmers, modifying the Blueprint is easy due to its visual and intuitive nature.


If a Blueprint is a car then components are the building blocks that make up the car. The doors, wheels and engine are all examples of components.
