### [69\. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of _x_, where _x_ is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## Solution 1: Binary Search

### Idea: 

### Code: 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {

        int left = 0, right = x, mid;
        while(left<right)
        {
            mid = left + (right - left + 1) /2;
            if(x/mid < mid)
            {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            else
            {
                left = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```
