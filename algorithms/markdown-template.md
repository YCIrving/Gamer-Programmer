# 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_** one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Solution 1: Brute force

### Idea: 

使用两个变量进行遍历，直到满足条件为止。

### Code: 

```c++
// paste your code here
```

### Complexity Analysis: 

- Time complexity : $O(n^2)$. 
- Space complexity : $O(1)$. 

### Details:

> Runtime: 148 ms, faster than 27.61% of C++ online submissions.
>
> Memory Usage: 9.2 MB, less than 99.94% of C++ online submissions.
